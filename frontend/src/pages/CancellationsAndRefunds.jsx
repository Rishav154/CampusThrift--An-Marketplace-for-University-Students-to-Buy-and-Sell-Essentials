                Rishav Prasad believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and has therefore a liberal
                cancellation policy. Under this policy: Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made
                within 3-5 days of placing the order. However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if the
                orders have been communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping
                them. Rishav Prasad does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers, eatables
                etc. However, refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the quality of product
                delivered is not good. In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please report the same to our
                Customer Service team. The request will, however, be entertained once the merchant has checked and
                determined the same at his own end. This should be reported within 3-5 days of receipt of the products.
                In case you feel that the product received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you
                must bring it to the notice of our customer service within 3-5 days of receiving the product. The
                Customer Service Team after looking into your complaint will take an appropriate decision. In case of
                complaints regarding products that come with a warranty from manufacturers, please refer the issue to
                them. In case of any Refunds approved by the Rishav Prasad, it’ll take 3-5 days for the refund to be
                processed to the end customer.

                CampusThrift is a platform that connects student buyers and sellers. We do not manage product inventory
                or shipping directly. As such, all cancellations and refund policies are set and handled by individual
                sellers.
                <br/><br/>
                Cancellations may be accepted only if the seller has not yet shipped the item. Once a shipment is
                initiated,
                cancellation requests may be declined at the seller’s discretion.
                <br/><br/>
                Refunds or replacements are only applicable if:
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside my-2 ml-4">
                    <li>The product delivered is damaged or defective.</li>
                    <li>The product received is significantly different from the listing.</li>
                </ul>
                In such cases, buyers must contact the seller within 6–8 days of receiving the product, and include
                proof
                (e.g., images or description of the issue). The seller will evaluate the request and respond
                accordingly.
                <br/><br/>
                If the item includes a manufacturer warranty, users are encouraged to contact the manufacturer directly.
                <br/><br/>
                Any refund issued by the seller may take 3–5 business days to reflect, depending on the payment
                provider.
